# Python Learning Journey  

My personal journey in **Python, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning**.  
---

## Structure
- `01_basics/` – Python basics (variables, loops, functions)
- `02_projects/` – Small practice projects
- `03_machine_learning/` – ML projects with **Scikit-Learn** & Kaggle mini-projects
- `04_pandas_practice/` – Data analysis with **pandas**
- `05_deep_learning/` – Neural Networks with **TensorFlow/Keras** 🆕
- `06_nlp_sentiment_analysis` – Sentiment Analysis (TF-IDF + Naive Bayes)
---

## Progress
- Python Basics
- Practice Projects
- Machine Learning (regression, classification, KNN, pipelines)
- Deep Learning – **in progress** (neural nets, hidden layers, activation functions)
- NLP - (TF-IDF, tokenization, stopwords)*
---

## Goal  
Step by step: from basics → projects → real AI tools.
