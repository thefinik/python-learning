# Python Learning Journey  

My personal journey in **Python, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning**.  

---

## Structure
- `01_basics/` â€“ Python basics (variables, loops, functions)
- `02_projects/` â€“ Small practice projects
- `03_machine_learning/` â€“ ML projects with **Scikit-Learn** & Kaggle mini-projects
- `04_pandas_practice/` â€“ Data analysis with **pandas**
- `05_deep_learning/` â€“ Neural Networks with **TensorFlow/Keras** ðŸ†•

## Progress
- Python Basics
- Practice Projects
- Machine Learning (regression, classification, KNN, pipelines)
- Deep Learning â€“ **in progress** (neural nets, hidden layers, activation functions)

---

## Goal  
Step by step: from basics â†’ projects â†’ real AI tools.
